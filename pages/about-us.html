      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Quis minima nisi repudiandae ipsum voluptatibus, eaque accusantium libero praesentium autem quia fugit unde saepe rem totam blanditiis neque suscipit alias recusandae. Our community of wellness started small in 1993, when Gary Young developed his first organic herb farming and distillation operation. At the time, Gary had already discovered the incredible power of essential oils, but because the quality of available oils varied so greatly, he’d been unable to fully harness their potential. While he knew that pure essential oils had the ability to produce spectacular results, he found that the chemically altered or adulterated oils on the market were often ineffective and even harmful.

        Young Living changed all that. As Gary developed more farmland in Utah and Idaho, he began cultivating lavender, peppermint, melissa, clary sage, and many other herbs. Fueled by a growing demand for pure essential oils, Young Living designed and built the largest, most technologically advanced distillery for the production of essential oils in North America. At the same time, our burgeoning company also developed the groundbreaking Young Living standard, which preserves the integrity and potency of natural essential oils.
        
        Today, Young Living has grown to become the world leader in essential oils and wellness solutions. Headquartered in Lehi, Utah, with offices in Australia, Europe, Canada, Japan and Singapore, as well as farms around the world, Young Living stays true to Gary Young’s original vision. And with our steadfast commitment to essential oil purity, we’ve inspired millions of people everywhere to experience nature's gifts of wellness and harmony, to create abundance as Young Living members, and to discover new opportunities for lifelong transformation.</p>
